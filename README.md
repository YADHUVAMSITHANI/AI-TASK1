DESCRIPTION : Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the AI model development pipeline, ensuring that raw data is transformed into a clean, consistent, and usable format.
The process involves several stages:
Data Cleaning: This step addresses inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the data. It involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
Techniques like imputation (filling in missing values with mean, median, or mode) and outlier detection are often used.
Data Transformation: In this stage, data is converted into a suitable format for analysis. This might include normalization or standardization of numerical data,
encoding categorical variables, and creating new features through techniques like polynomial expansion or feature crossing.
Data Integration: When data comes from multiple sources, it needs to be integrated into a cohesive dataset.This might involve merging datasets and resolving any discrepancies between them.
Data Reduction: To enhance efficiency, data reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or feature selection are applied to reduce the number of variables while retaining the most important information.
Data Splitting: The processed data is then split into training, validation, and test sets. This ensures that the AI model is trained and evaluated on different subsets of data to prevent overfitting and to validate its performance on unseen data.
Preprocessing ensures the data is in the best shape possible for training robust, accurate, and efficient AI models. Each step requires careful consideration of the data’s nature and the specific requirements of the intended AI algorithms.
